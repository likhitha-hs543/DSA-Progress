# 📌 DSA Progress — 160-Day Challenge

This repository documents my **160-day Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) challenge**.

I solve problems daily and log solutions, learnings, and patterns to build consistency and improve problem-solving skills.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Build strong fundamentals in DSA  
- Improve logical thinking and problem decomposition  
- Maintain daily consistency  
- Prepare effectively for coding interviews
